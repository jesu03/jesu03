npm install --save react-toastify

Sample code for toastify ::

import React from 'react';

import { ToastContainer, toast } from 'react-toastify';
import 'react-toastify/dist/ReactToastify.css';
  
const App = () =>{
    const notify = () => toast("Wow so easy!");
    return (
      <div>
        <button onClick={notify}>Notify!</button>
        <ToastContainer />
      </div>
    );
  }
export default App

## **Callback Response Codes Documentation**

### **Overview**

Callback response codes are standardized indicators used by our system to communicate the result or status of an asynchronous operation. These codes are especially important for external systems, developers, and internal support teams to understand the state of a callback request, determine next steps, and handle exceptions appropriately.

This document outlines the meaning and implications of each response code and provides guidance on how to interpret and act on them.

### **Response Code Definitions**

| **Code** | **Label**            | **Description**                                                                   |
| -------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 20       | **Completed**        | The callback was successfully processed. No further action is required.           |
| 02       | **Processing Error** | An internal error occurred during processing. The request may need to be retried. |
| 09       | **Invalid Request**  | The request format or data was incorrect. Review the request payload.             |
| 06       | **Max Attempts**     | The request has reached the maximum number of retry attempts without success.     |
| 07       | **Expired**          | The callback window expired before completion. A new request may be needed.       |
| 600      | **Resend Requested** | A resend has been requested, usually due to failure in delivery or timeout.       |
| 601      | **Request Canceled** | The request was manually or systemically canceled before processing completed.    |

### **Usage Guidelines**

* **Monitoring & Logging**: Each response code should be logged for auditing and troubleshooting purposes.
* **Automated Handling**:

  * Code `20` indicates success and should be treated as terminal.
  * Codes like `02`, `600` may be eligible for automatic retry logic.
  * Codes `06`, `07`, `601` typically indicate a final state and may require user intervention or logging only.
* **Integration Notes**: External systems consuming these callbacks should map these codes appropriately in their workflows and error-handling mechanisms.

---

### **Troubleshooting Tips**

* **Frequent 02 (Processing Error)**: Review system logs for exceptions. Consider implementing a retry strategy with exponential backoff.
* **09 (Invalid Request)**: Validate the request body structure, headers, and data types. Schema validation tools can help.
* **600 (Resend Requested)**: Ensure your system supports idempotency if multiple deliveries of the same request are possible.

### **Conclusion**

Understanding and correctly handling callback response codes is crucial for building reliable and maintainable systems. Use this document as a quick reference when debugging or designing integrations that rely on asynchronous callbacks.
