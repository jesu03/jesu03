## **Callback Response Codes**

This section provides definitions for standard callback response codes used in the system. These codes help identify the status or result of a callback request.

| **Code** | **Definition**                                                              |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 20       | **Completed** – The request has been successfully processed.                |
| 02       | **Processing Error** – An error occurred while processing the request.      |
| 09       | **Invalid Request** – The request format or content is not valid.           |
| 06       | **Max Attempts** – The maximum number of allowed attempts has been reached. |
| 07       | **Expired** – The request has expired and is no longer valid.               |
| 600      | **Resend Requested** – A resend of the original request has been triggered. |
| 601      | **Request Canceled** – The request was canceled by the user or system.      |

> **Note:** These codes are critical for understanding the outcome of callback transactions. Always refer to this table when troubleshooting or integrating with callback endpoints.
